test, hello.
<br>
yes, i'm using github pages with cloudflare, full ssl support, htts preloaded.
<br>
am i happy?<br>
no. my gTLD(.tk) flagged as spammy tld, so my seo ranking won't be as good as other gTLDs.
<br>i don't see much .tk domains holding the top of the serp, even the first page.
<br>now i've got to buy some prejudice gTLD.. it's f*ing expensive now, income of two days work, in my country, turkiye.
